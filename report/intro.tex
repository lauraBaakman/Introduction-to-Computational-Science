\todo[inline]{Why is looking at the rupture dynamics of mud/paint useful. Give a nice example, e.g., the Mona Lisa.}

\todo[inline]{How is this problem tackled before. E.g., Vogel et al. which models the rupture dynamics of mud in the following way: ... -> conclusion a slow but representative model/method.}

\todo[inline]{Global idea of the model/method presented in this paper. ... -> hypothesis: fast but maybe not as a representative model and simulation of the crack dynamics of mud/paint.}


\Cref{s:method} presents the theory behind the presented method. The implementation of our simulation is introduced in \cref{s:implementation}. \Cref{s:ExperimentsDiscussion} presents the experiments we performed with our implementation and presents and reviews the gathered results. Finally, \cref{s:conclusion} discusses our conclusion.
