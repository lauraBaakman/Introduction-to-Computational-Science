\todo[inline]{Intro plus what one can find in this section... }
When simulating the dynamics of cracking material, one needs a model that represents the properties of that materials, i.e., in the case of this paper mud or paint. In \cref{ss:method:model} we firstly present our model. To be able to show the contrast between the models, in \cref{ss:method:contrast}, we shortly review the model given by \citeauthor{vogel2005studies2} in \cref{ss:method:vogel}.

\subsection{The model}\label{ss:method:model}

\laura{Read the following paragraph(s) which should implement the following todo: ``Decribe our model:  1. Properties of single particles and connection between two (springs)''}
To model the rupture dynamics of mud we opted for a spring simulation. In this simulation Mud is modeled by particles connected by springs. The cracking of mud is a very slow process and therefore we do not take the velocity and frictional forces into consideration, i.e., we ignore Newton's laws of motion and Stokes' law, which describes friction. We can therefore keep the particles massless and the simulation process simple, by only considering the locations of the particles.

The image in \cref{fig:method:spring} shows the illustration of a single connection between two particles $v_i$ and $v_j$. The connection, as stated in the previous paragraph, is modeled with using a spring. The force on a Hookean spring is given by $F = -k X\,$, where $F$ is restoring force exerted by the spring on whatever is pulling on the other end. If the stress on a spring exceeds some threshold, or is among the $k$ springs with the highest stress (see \cref{s:implementation}), it breaks and cracks appear.
