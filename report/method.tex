\todo[inline]{Intro plus what one can find in this section... }

\subsection{The model}

\todo[inline]{Decribe our model:  1. Properties of single particles and connection between two (springs)}

\todo[inline]{Describe our model: 2. Initialization of the grid and spring constants. (Which distribution and parameters)}

\todo[inline]{Describe how the model can be solved/stabilized}

\todo[inline]{Decribe how springs break (two or three methods)}

\todo[inline]{Reference that the step after this is the solve/stabilization part of this section.}

\subsection{The Vogel model}

\todo[inline]{Short review of the model from Vogel et al. So we can contrast this in the last section}

\subsection{Contrast}

\todo[inline]{Describe the important differences of the two models.}


\todo[inline]{Story from the presentation. Different types of particles. Springs. How the particles are connected, with those springs (square uniform grid). Things like energy and what is a stable system?}
