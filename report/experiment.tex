	\caption{Several steps of the breaking of springs, where the 97 springs with the highest strain were broken. The grid had 1200 particles, the spring constants were sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0. Step 0 is a stabilization of the initial grid, presented in \cref{fig:implementation:stabilizedInitial}, the following steps are the stabilization and breaking steps of the algorithm.}

	\input{results_greater}					
	\caption{Several steps of the breaking of springs, where the springs with a strain greater than 1.04 were broken. The grid had 1200 particles, the spring constants were sampled from a normal distribution with mean 0.0 and standard deviation 1.0. Step 0 is a stabilization of the initial grid, presented in \cref{fig:implementation:stabilizedInitial}, the following steps are the stabilization and breaking steps of the algorithm.}
