In this section we present and discuss some of the experiments we have performed with our simulation. Each experiment in this section was performed on a grid of 1200 particles, with the spring constants sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.99. The seed was reset to the same value at the start of each simulation, consequently all initial grids have the same spring constants. When a number of springs under the highest strain was broken, we broken 97 springs at each step. When the second method was used we broke the springs with a strain greater than 1.04 If springs were stretched $\vartheta = 0.1$.

Below we discuss the possible combinations of breaking versus stretching and the different conditions under which springs are either broken or stretched.

\Cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain} presents the results of breaking a number of springs with the highest strain. Initially, \cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain:0,fig:experiment:highestStrain:1}, the pattern resembles cracked mud. However as the simulation progresses the patterns start to resemble a popped balloon, this is especially noticeable in \cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain:6,fig:experiment:highestStrain:7,fig:experiment:highestStrain:8}. When there are no more springs to break the particles have all moved to the lower left corner of the simulation, the point with coordinate $(0,0)$.
