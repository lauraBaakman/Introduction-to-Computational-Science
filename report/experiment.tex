In this section we present and discuss some of the experiments we have performed with our simulation. Each experiment in this section was performed on a grid of 1200 particles, with the spring constants sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.99. The seed was reset to the same value at the start of each simulation, consequently all initial grids have the same spring constants. When a number of springs under the highest strain where broken, we broke 97 springs at each step. When the second method was used, we broke the springs with a strain greater than $1.04$. % If springs were stretched $\vartheta = 0.1$.

Below we discuss the possible combinations of breaking versus stretching and the different conditions under which springs are either broken or stretched. Lastly we review the parameters that influence the breaking and stretching of springs.

	\Cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain} presents the results of breaking a number of springs with the highest strain. Initially, \cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain:0,fig:experiment:highestStrain:1}, the pattern resembles cracked mud. However as the simulation progresses the patterns start to resemble a popped balloon, this is especially noticeable in \cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain:6,fig:experiment:highestStrain:7,fig:experiment:highestStrain:8}. When there are no more springs to break the particles have all moved to the lower left corner of the simulation, the point with coordinate $(0,0)$.

	In \cref{fig:experiment:greaterThanStrain} steps of the simulation where springs are broken if there strain is greater then 1.04 are shown. Initially the results are comparable to those presented in \cref{fig:experiment:highestStrain}, however as the simulation progress the results are more like cracking mud, than a popping balloon. In \cref{fig:experiment:greaterThanStrain:7} there are no more springs to break, as the strain on any spring is smaller than $1.04$. Once could consider this state as a completely dried layer of matter, and adjust the threshold strain according to the material. Alternatively one could choose to decrease the strain threshold as the simulation advances.
